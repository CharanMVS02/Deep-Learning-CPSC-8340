# Deep-Learning-CPSC-8340

This repository was created for a homework assignment on deep learning. It contains several .ipynb files, which include Python code snippets and the corresponding results, executed sequentially. These files demonstrate the work I've done related to deep learning.

Setup Instructions:
Environment Setup: All the code files can be run in Jupyter Notebook. To use Jupyter Notebook, you must first install Anaconda.

PyTorch Installation: After installing Anaconda, open the Anaconda prompt to install PyTorch by running the following command: conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
Running the Code: Once the installation is complete, launch Jupyter Notebook, import the necessary files from the repository, and run the code within the notebook environment.

This setup will allow you to reproduce the results from the deep learning assignment.
